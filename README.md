# EDA on German Credit Dataset
This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the German Credit Dataset. It offers valuable insights and visualizations to help you better understand the data's trends, patterns, and correlations. I have also included the detailed EDA report and dataset within this repository for your reference.

# Dataset
The German Credit Dataset consists of 1,000 credit samples, with each of them having 9 features such as Age, Sex, Job, Housing, Saving/Checking account, Purpose, etc., that describe the category and characteristics of each borrower. The dataset has 1000 rows and 10 columns.

# Contents of the dataset:
